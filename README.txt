All the functionalities mentioned in the rubric are implemented. However I would suggest all the reviewers to explore the features first. Login with members and admins to check the functionalities.
We have used flags for admins and members. 

So, the same user ID can be member as well as admin. That makes sense as every user cannot have different email ID's for members and admins.
